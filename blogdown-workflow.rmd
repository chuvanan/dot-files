### Recipe for writing a new post

* Start up an R session in your website directory, and use
  `blogdown::new_post()` to generate an RMarkdown file for your post (you're not
  recommended to do it yourself).

```{r}
blogdown::new_post(
              title = "A recipe for writing a new post",
              ext = ".rmd"
          )
```

* To preview your website, run this:

```{r}
blogdown::serve_site()
```
