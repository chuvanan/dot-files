    `blogdown::new_post()` to generate an RMarkdown file for your post
    (youâ€™re not recommended to do it yourself).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
blogdown::new_post(
              title = "A recipe for writing a new post",
              ext = ".rmd"
          )
```

  - To preview your website, run this:
