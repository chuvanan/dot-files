#+TITLE: Install R from source

This short note is a guide for Ubuntu/Mint users (me in the future) who want to
install R programming language from source (because you want some [[https://rviews.rstudio.com/2018/03/21/multiple-versions-of-r/][customization
/ optimization]] or simply due to Ubuntu repositories are way too late to update
latest R binary release)

- Install the build dependencies required for R

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt build-dep r-base
#+END_SRC

- Download and extract source code

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.0.5.tar.gz
tar -xzvf R-4.0.5.tar.gz
cd R-4.0.5
#+END_SRC

- Configure and build R

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./configure --prefix=/opt/R/4.0.5 --enable-R-shlib --with-blas --with-cairo --with-libtiff --enable-memory-profiling --without-recommended-packages --disable-java
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

- Make R's executable files searchable by creating symbolic link in ~/bin~

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo ln /opt/R/4.0.5/bin/R -s R
sudo ln /opt/R/4.0.5/bin/Rscript -s Rscript
#+END_SRC

- Check

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
which R
#+END_SRC

*** Possible issues

- R-3.5.0 failed to enable cairo graphics. This ~capabilities("cairo")~ should
  return TRUE (as configured above). Make cairo as default graphic engine by
  putting the following lines of code into ~.Rprofile~

#+BEGIN_SRC r
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
        function(...) grDevices::X11.options(type = 'cairo'))
options(device = 'x11')
#+END_SRC

PS: I've updated the build configuration with the removal of *--with-lapack* as
it is strongly advised by the official R [[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#LAPACK][documentation]].

PPS: It happens quite often to me that my machine will lack some sort of =.sty=
file for compiling =.Rnw=. A quick fix is to download the missing file from the
internet and put it into `share/texmf/tex/latex/`.
